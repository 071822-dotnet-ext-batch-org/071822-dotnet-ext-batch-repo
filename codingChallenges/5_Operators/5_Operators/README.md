# Operators Challenge
Implement the following methods using the required operators:

- Implement the Increment() method that takes in an int and returns the incremented input (use an increment operator)  
- Implement the Decrement() method  that takes in an int and returns the decremented input (use a decrement operator)
- Implement the Not() method that returns the opposite of a boolean input 
- Implement the Negate() method that takes in an int and returns the negative of a number if the input is negative, and its positive if the input is negative 
- Implement the Sum() method that returns the sum of two numbers
- Implement the Diff() method that returns the difference of two numbers.
- Implement the Product() method that returns the product of two numbers
- Implement the Quotient() method that returns the result when the first input is divided by the second input
- Implement the Remainder() method that returns the remainder when the first input is divided by the second input
- Implement the And() method that checks if the first number is not equal to 0 and if it's greater than the second number
- Implement the Or() method that checks if the first number is equal to the second number or if the first number is less than 0

# Operator Types
unary operators like increment(++) and decrement(--)
binary operators like + , - , * , / , % , ! , != , bool (like < , > , ==)
conditionals (like && , ||)
