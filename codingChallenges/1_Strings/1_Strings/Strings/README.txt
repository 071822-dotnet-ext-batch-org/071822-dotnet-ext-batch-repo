Challenge 1 – String and its methods

Now you know the use of various string functions. 
Let’s create a small Console application to practice using the 
string manipulation methods that are included with .NET while getting input from the user
and calling methods.
You can call the methods in whatever order you want, just make sure the body of the method 
returns the expected result or the test cases will not pass.

TIP: You can ctrl-click any .NET method name to go to the .NET definition of the method within .NET.

Steps:
1. In Main() you will have some user interaction. This isn't tested, but it's good practice.
2. Use Console.WriteLine() to give instructions and Console.ReadLine() to get user input with which you can call the methods.
3. You will need to convert the string returned from Console.ReadLine() to an integer to send it to methods.
4. Call each of the provided methods with the correct arguments, according to the instruction in the XML comments above the 
    method and replace the method body of each with the correct C# syntax to fulfill the requirements of the method.
